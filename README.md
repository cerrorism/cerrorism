- **Backend Development**: Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, self-hosted runners
- **Homelab**: K3s, various automation experiments

## 🏠 Current Projects

## 🎮 When I'm Not Coding

- PC/console gaming 
- Optimizing my homelab setup
- Experimenting with automation
- Breaking things with purpose (and hopefully fixing them)

## 💭 My Philosophy

> *"Build often. Break things with purpose."*

I believe in learning through hands-on experimentation, sharing knowledge openly, and that the best way to understand something is to build it yourself.
